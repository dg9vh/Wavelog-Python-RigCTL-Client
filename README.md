## What is it about?

This is a little tiny GUI-Client that connects via rigctl-protocol to your transceiver, reads the actual frequency, mode and power and pushes it via the radio-API to your Wavelog or Cloudlog-logbook.

All you need for have it running is the correct API-endpoint and, for sure, your API-key configured in the ini-file.
